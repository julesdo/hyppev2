Most teams grow in silos: marketing builds the site, ops run manual processes, data comes late.  
At Hyppe, weâ€™ve seen again and again that growth accelerates when the **stack is unified**.

## The Playbook

### 1. Fast Website
- Next.js, SEO-friendly, optimized for conversion  
- The entry point that doesnâ€™t leak traffic  

### 2. Smart Automations
- n8n / trigger.dev flows  
- Remove repetitive work (reporting, CRM updates, notifications)

### 3. Analytics & Dashboards
- Umami for GDPR-friendly analytics  
- Power BI or custom dashboards for KPIs  

## Results from real clients

- Aqui Media: faster publishing + clean editorial analytics  
- Source Private Asset: investor dashboards auto-updated  
- Anne Mondy: storefront with automated product sync  

## Lessons

- Start with one stack, not ten tools  
- Make ROI visible â€” hours saved and conversions gained  
- Growth compounds when site, ops, and analytics work together  

ðŸ‘‰ This is the **Growth Stack** we ship. Simple, measurable, scalable.
