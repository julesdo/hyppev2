Artists need two things online: **a storefront that feels unique** and **operations that donâ€™t eat their time.**  
For Anne Mondy, selling art wasnâ€™t just about putting products online â€” it was about creating a professional experience that reflected her brand, while avoiding hours of admin for every new piece.

## The Playbook

### 1. Custom storefront
We built a headless Shopify front-end with Next.js, Tailwind and motion effects. The result: a **fast, branded site** that feels like the artist, not like Shopifyâ€™s default theme.

### 2. Automating derivative products
Every time a new artwork is added, an automation pipeline generates derivative products: tote bags, posters, digital mockups. No manual copy-pasting, no inconsistent names.

### 3. Keep the best of Shopify
Behind the scenes, Shopify still runs inventory, payments, and logistics. Headless gives freedom in design, Shopify keeps the reliability.

## The Results

- **New products appear automatically** when originals are added  
- **Consistent descriptions and mockups** without manual work  
- **Hours saved weekly**, reinvested into creating and marketing  

## Lessons for Creators

- Metadata is your backbone: keep it clean.  
- Automations should reflect your creative workflow, not fight it.  
- Headless = freedom to design, without losing Shopifyâ€™s engine.  

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™re an artist or creative, headless + automation gives you both **control and scale.**
