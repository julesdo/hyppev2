Artists need custom UX without losing Shopify’s ecosystem. Here’s the approach we used for Anne Mondy.

## Architecture

- Next.js App Router + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- Shopify Storefront GraphQL API for products, collections, cart
- Server actions for secure mutations; webhooks for sync

## Automation: derivative products

- Express.js worker + Redis job queue
- Triggered when a new original artwork is added in Shopify
- Generates derivative SKUs with consistent naming
- Creates dynamic descriptions and mockups

## Why this works

- Custom UI/UX for an artist’s brand
- Full Shopify features (inventory, payments, shipping)
- Automation removes hours of repetitive work

## Lessons

- Keep product metadata clean; it’s the backbone of automations.
- Rate‑limit and batch API calls; include retries and idempotency keys.
- Model the workflow as states (queued → processing → done → failed) for observability.

If you sell art online, headless + targeted automations deliver speed, control, and compounding output.
