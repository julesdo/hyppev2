excerpt: "Every extra second costs conversions. Here’s a playbook to measure, fix, and prove the ROI of website speed."

When a website feels slow, trust drops. And when trust drops, conversions follow.  
In projects like **Aqui Media** and **Anne Mondy’s headless store**, speed was the difference between a visitor browsing and a visitor buying.

## Why speed matters

- 1s slower = up to **20% drop in conversion**  
- Mobile bounce rates increase dramatically past 3s  
- Investors, partners, and buyers see speed as **credibility**

## The Playbook

1. **Measure first**  
   - Use Lighthouse or Umami with Core Web Vitals tracking  
   - Focus on LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) and TTI (Time to Interactive)

2. **Quick wins**  
   - Optimize images (WebP/AVIF, responsive sizes)  
   - Cache at route or CDN level  
   - Preload fonts, avoid layout shift

3. **Advanced wins**  
   - Route-level streaming in Next.js  
   - Remove unused scripts/libraries  
   - Monitor in production with RUM (real user monitoring)

## Results we’ve seen

- Aqui Media: faster article load → **+18% more sessions per visitor**  
- Anne Mondy: optimized storefront → **smoother checkout on mobile**  

## Lessons Learned

- Speed = trust. Users don’t explain it, but they feel it.  
- Small technical wins compound into business ROI.  
- Make it measurable — it’s not a “nice to have,” it’s a lever for growth.
