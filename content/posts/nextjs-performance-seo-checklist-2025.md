  A practical checklist to make your Next.js site fast, indexable, and resilient - without yak-shaving.

A focused checklist you can run in a day to improve performance, crawlability, and perceived quality.

## Rendering & data

- Prefer RSC + streaming for above‑the‑fold content.
- Cache at the right layer (route segment / fetch cache / CDN) with clear invalidation rules.
- Co‑locate data dependencies per segment; avoid global waterfalls.

## Assets

- Use `next/image` with proper `sizes` and WebP/AVIF sources.
- Preload critical fonts; use font subsetting; avoid layout shift.
- Defer non‑essential scripts; remove unused libraries.

## UI responsiveness

- Animate with transforms/opacities only; avoid layout thrash.
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility.
- Keep interactions responsive under 100ms (idle work with `requestIdleCallback`).

## SEO signals

- Unique titles/descriptions per route; OG/Twitter images.
- Clean URLs, canonical tags, and structured data for articles/products.
- XML sitemap + robots; monitor coverage in Search Console.

## Monitoring

- Measure Core Web Vitals in production (Umami/GA + RUM).
- Track error budgets and slow queries; set budgets for image weight.

Run this checklist quarterly. Small fixes compound. Your visitors — and revenue — will feel the difference.
