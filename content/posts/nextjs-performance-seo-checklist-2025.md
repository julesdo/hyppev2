Performance isnâ€™t magic. Itâ€™s discipline.  
This checklist is the one we use internally to make sure every Next.js site we ship is **fast, SEO-ready, and resilient.**

## Rendering & Data

- Use React Server Components + streaming for faster above-the-fold.  
- Cache at the right level: route segment, fetch cache, or CDN.  
- Keep data dependencies local to each route to avoid waterfalls.  

## Assets

- Always use `next/image` with WebP/AVIF.  
- Preload critical fonts, subset them, avoid layout shifts.  
- Remove unused scripts, defer whatâ€™s non-critical.  

## UI Responsiveness

- Animate with transform/opacity only.  
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.  
- Keep all interactions <100ms.  

## SEO Signals

- Titles + descriptions unique per route.  
- Canonical tags + structured data for articles/products.  
- XML sitemap, robots.txt, and monitoring via Search Console.  

## Monitoring

- Track Core Web Vitals in production.  
- Watch error rates and slow queries.  
- Set budgets (image weight, script size).  

ðŸ‘‰ Run this checklist every quarter. Small wins compound â€” and your SEO and revenue will thank you.
