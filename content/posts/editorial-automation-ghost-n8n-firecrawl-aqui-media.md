Aqui Media runs on a headless stack and a robust workflow that reduces manual steps.

## Stack

- Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion (frontend)
- Ghost CMS (headless) for content
- Umami for lightweight analytics
- n8n + Node (Firecrawl) with rotating proxies for web monitoring and enrichment

## Flow

1. Monitor sources (Firecrawl) → enqueue relevant items
2. Enrich and normalize → push to Ghost as drafts
3. Human review in Ghost → publish → Next.js revalidates
4. Alerts and reporting via email + dashboard

## Impact

- Faster publishing, fewer errors, consistent structure
- Editors focus on quality and context, not plumbing

Automating the routine increases the time spent on storytelling — where media wins.
