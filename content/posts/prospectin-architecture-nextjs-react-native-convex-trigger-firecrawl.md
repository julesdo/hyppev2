Finding the right meetings abroad is hard. Too many events, too little context, too many follow-ups slipping through the cracks.  
**ProspectIn was built to solve that.**

## The Playbook

### Discovery
Firecrawl + proxies monitor Meetup, Eventbrite, LinkedIn. Signals are enriched with profiles and speakers to spot the right events.

### Planning
Qualified leads sync to Google/Outlook calendars, with notes and reminders.  
Sales teams land in a new city already knowing where to go and who to meet.

### Follow-up
Automated sequences tied to CRM ensure no conversation is lost.  
The system tracks outcomes, not just activity.

## Architecture

- Next.js (web) + React Native (mobile)  
- Convex for realtime data  
- trigger.dev for orchestration  
- Workers for scraping + enrichment  

## ROI Dashboard

- **Time saved vs manual prospecting**  
- **Meetings held and converted**  
- **Pipeline value generated**  

ðŸ‘‰ The focus is not tech for techâ€™s sake. Itâ€™s about **better meetings, better follow-ups, better outcomes.**
