Prospecting takes time. Scrolling through Meetup, Eventbrite, LinkedIn, then copy-pasting into a CRM.  
We built an **automated B2B prospecting pipeline** to remove that drag.

## The Playbook

1. **Discovery**  
   - Scrape event platforms automatically  
   - Capture key details (title, speakers, attendees)

2. **Enrichment**  
   - Cross-check with LinkedIn and company data  
   - Score fit with a simple model

3. **Outreach**  
   - Auto-sync to CRM  
   - Sequences run via email tools

## Results

- **60% less preparation time**  
- **‚Ç¨5,000 new revenue in 3 months**  
- Teams focus on conversations, not copy-paste

## Lessons

- Automation scales the top of funnel, but qualification is still human  
- Keep enrichment transparent ‚Äî false positives kill trust  
- ROI comes not from ‚Äúmore data,‚Äù but from **faster actions**  

üëâ If your sales team spends hours researching events, you‚Äôre losing money.
