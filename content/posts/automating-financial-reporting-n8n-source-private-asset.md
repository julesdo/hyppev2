Manual reporting is slow and error‑prone. We built a predictable pipeline for Source Private Asset.

## Design principles

- Event‑driven with webhooks, not fragile cron
- Clear schemas for inputs/outputs; idempotent steps with retries
- Human approval gates for sensitive steps

## Flow overview

1. Ingest data from sources (APIs/CSVs) → validate
2. Transform → compute KPIs → generate artifacts
3. Route to stakeholders (investors/distributors) with audit logs

## Tooling

- n8n for orchestration
- Signed webhooks between systems
- Storage with versioning; lightweight Redis cache

The outcome: on‑time reports, fewer manual touches, and higher confidence.
