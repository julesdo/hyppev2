Hyppe builds fast, elegant websites and automations so teams can focus on their core business. This playbook summarizes what consistently moves the needle across speed, conversion, and operations.

## Why speed and automation matter

- Speed drives trust and conversion. Every 100ms saved reduces friction and drop‑offs.
- Automation removes low‑value work (exports, manual copy‑pastes, status pings), freeing hours weekly.
- Combined, they compound ROI: more traffic converted, fewer hours wasted, clearer data.

## The stack that scales

- Web: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion
- Content: Ghost CMS or headless Shopify
- Automations: n8n / trigger.dev, webhooks, custom workers
- Data: Umami analytics, Redis cache

## Three quick wins (real projects)

1) Aqui Media — editorial automation and growth
   - Next.js + Ghost CMS (headless) + Umami
   - n8n + Node (Firecrawl) for smart monitoring and content enrichment with rotating proxies
   - Result: a publishing flow that’s faster, more reliable, less manual

2) Anne Mondy — headless Shopify for artists
   - Next.js + Shopify GraphQL
   - Express + Redis job queue to auto‑create derivative products from originals with dynamic descriptions and mockups
   - Result: new inventory generated automatically, consistent copy, time saved

3) Source Private Asset — reporting automation
   - Next.js site redesign + n8n flows
   - Automated data pulls and report distribution to investors
   - Result: fewer manual steps, quicker investor updates, less risk of errors

## Implementation principles

- Ship thin slices fast. Measure, then scale what works.
- Prefer webhooks over cron for event‑driven reliability.
- Keep a clear contract between the site and the automation layer (ids, statuses, webhooks).
- Track operational metrics (time saved, failure rate, retries) alongside traffic and conversion.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Over‑engineering. Start with the smallest automation that replaces a real manual step.
- Black‑box workflows. Always log inputs/outputs and keep a manual fallback.
- Ignoring the human loop. Automations should augment, not surprise, your team.

## Where to start this week

- Page speed audit → image optimization, caching, and route‑level streaming.
- One manual process → turn into a webhook + worker job.
- Instrument analytics and operational KPIs so you can see the impact.

The result: a site that converts and operations that scale — without adding headcount.
