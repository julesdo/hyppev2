This playbook summarizes what consistently moves the needle across speed, conversion, and operations.\r\n\r\n## Why speed and automation matter\r\n\r\n- Speed drives trust and conversion. Every 100ms saved reduces friction and drop‑offs.\r\n- Automation removes low‑value work (exports, manual copy‑pastes, status pings), freeing hours weekly.\r\n- Combined, they compound ROI: more traffic converted, fewer hours wasted, clearer data.\r\n\r\n## The stack that scales\r\n\r\n- Web: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion\r\n- Content: Ghost CMS or headless Shopify\r\n- Automations: n8n / trigger.dev, webhooks, custom workers\r\n- Data: Umami analytics, Redis cache\r\n\r\n## Three quick wins (real projects)\r\n\r\n1) Aqui Media — editorial automation and growth\r\n   - Next.js + Ghost CMS (headless) + Umami\r\n   - n8n + Node (Firecrawl) for smart monitoring and content enrichment with rotating proxies\r\n   - Result: a publishing flow that’s faster, more reliable, less manual\r\n\r\n2) Anne Mondy — headless Shopify for artists\r\n   - Next.js + Shopify GraphQL\r\n   - Express + Redis job queue to auto‑create derivative products from originals with dynamic descriptions and mockups\r\n   - Result: new inventory generated automatically, consistent copy, time saved\r\n\r\n3) Source Private Asset — reporting automation\r\n   - Next.js site redesign + n8n flows\r\n   - Automated data pulls and report distribution to investors\r\n   - Result: fewer manual steps, quicker investor updates, less risk of errors\r\n\r\n## Implementation principles\r\n\r\n- Ship thin slices fast. Measure, then scale what works.\r\n- Prefer webhooks over cron for event‑driven reliability.\r\n- Keep a clear contract between the site and the automation layer (ids, statuses, webhooks).\r\n- Track operational metrics (time saved, failure rate, retries) alongside traffic and conversion.\r\n\r\n## Common pitfalls to avoid\r\n\r\n- Over‑engineering. Start with the smallest automation that replaces a real manual step.\r\n- Black‑box workflows. Always log inputs/outputs and keep a manual fallback.\r\n- Ignoring the human loop. Automations should augment, not surprise, your team.\r\n\r\n## Where to start this week\r\n\r\n- Page speed audit → image optimization, caching, and route‑level streaming.\r\n- One manual process → turn into a webhook + worker job.\r\n- Instrument analytics and operational KPIs so you can see the impact.\r\n\r\nThe result: a site that converts and operations that scale — without adding headcount.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
